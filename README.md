This dataset is titled “SC Transcripts”, Supreme Court Transcripts.  
This is a collection of 9 oral argument transcripts from the Supreme Court.  
All the oral arguments took place from November 29th, 2021- December 8th, 2021.  

The genre of the dataset is transcript, and the disposition is publicly available on the Supreme Court website. 
The page range of individual transcripts ranges, from the shortest, 67 pages to, the longest, at 136 pages.  
The structure of the transcript is a standardized legal formatting and includes the briefing name, appearances, contents, proceedings, 
and a list of words present in the document with their occurring page and line number.  

Each speaker is indicated by their name preceding the written record of their comments.  
The dataset is important in providing a corpus for sentiment analysis, among the Supreme Court Justices, 
across all of the oral arguments from the November 29th, 2021- December 8th, 2021 argument session. 

Within this argument session, the Supreme Court heard Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, on December 1st, 2021.  
This case overturned the previously established right to abortion in Roe v. Wade.   
This study is interested in looking at sentiment analysis among Supreme Court Justices, 
specifically within Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization and comparing these findings to other court proceedings in which the case is not specifically gendered.  

In determining if a case is categorized as gendered, the hearing and pending legislations purvey would only apply to individuals of that gender, 
and or in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson, individuals with the ability to become pregnant.   

Within the dataset, 1 case, Dobbs v. Jackson is categorized as gendered.  The other 8 cases are not gendered.  
In analyzing sentiment analysis of Justices within gendered and non-gendered cases, through the scope of their own respective gender, 
trends can be identified in oral arguments proceedings.  

If there are consistent trends in Justices’ response to gendered cases, 
that is in opposition or alignment with their own gender, it could reveal gender bias within proceedings.
